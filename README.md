PROACTIVE DEFENSIVE STRATEGY AGAINST RANSOMWARE THREATS USING RANGAN AND HASH CONCEAL
Introduction
Ransomware is a malware in which attacker then demands a ransom payment, usually in cryptocurrency, in exchange for providing the decryption key to unlock the files. The current approaches to detect such ransomware include monitoring processes, system calls, and file activities on the target system and analysing the data collected. Monitoring multiple processes has a very high overhead; newer ransomware may interfere with the monitoring and corrupt the collected data. To address this concern, this project adopted an open design approach to enhance the robustness of the proposed method. The proposed method detect ransomware and protects critical files from existing ransomware by applying a hiding strategy that poses a challenge to attackers in finding the target files. This project developed a proactive defence strategy against ransomware threats, leveraging "RanGAN" for early detection and "Hash Conceal" for data protection. Together, these technologies form a robust defence, ensuring rapid threat identification and minimizing data loss. This strategy aims to fortify cybersecurity against the evolving ransomware landscape, providing a resilient shield for critical assets. This proactive approach
not only bolsters an organization's resilience to ransomware but also reduces the potential impact on
critical data and operations. By leveraging RanGAN for early threat detection and Hash Conceal for data protection, organizations can enhance their cybersecurity posture and safeguard against the evolving ransomware threat landscape.

Proposed Solution:
The proposed system for a proactive Anti Agent Against Ransomware Threats, integrating "RanGAN" and "Hash Conceal," is designed to provide a robust and comprehensive defense mechanism.
RanGAN Technology Integration:
RanGAN employs advanced machine learning techniques to actively monitor network and system activities, learning and recognizing ransomware behavior patterns in real-time.

Hash Conceal Implementation:
Hash Conceal employs advanced cryptographic methods to secure data, rendering it inaccessible to ransomware encryption.
